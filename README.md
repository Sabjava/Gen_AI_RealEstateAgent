### **Project Summary: Personalized Real Estate Agent**

This project demonstrates the development of a **Personalized Real Estate Agent** using cutting-edge technology like Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search to generate, store, and personalize real estate listings based on buyer preferences. The project includes the following key components:

#### **1. Synthetic Data Generation - Generating Real Estate Listings with an LLM**
The project leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to automatically generate diverse and realistic real estate listings. 11 listings were generated for houses in San Mateo county, CA, containing factual details such as property features (price, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.), descriptions, and neighborhood insights. 

#### **2. Semantic Search - Creating a Vector Database and Storing Listings**
To enable semantic search functionality, the project demonstrates the creation of a **vector database**. I used Chroma database. The listings generated by the LLM are processed to create embeddings, which are then stored within the database. This system allows for efficient organization and retrieval of listings based on the semantic content rather than just keyword matching, improving the search experience for users. 

#### **3. Semantic Search of Listings Based on Buyer Preferences**
A key feature of the application is the ability to **semantically search listings** based on a buyer's preferences. When a user provides specific preferences (e.g., price range, neighborhood, number of bedrooms), the system performs a search through the vector database to return listings that best match the input criteria. The results are ranked based on how closely they align with the buyer's preferences.

#### **4. Augmented Response Generation - Logic for Searching and Augmenting Listing Descriptions**
The project also includes **augmented response generation**. After the listings are retrieved through the semantic search, the system uses buyer preferences to **augment the descriptions** of the listings. This enhancement tailors the listing descriptions, adding details that are aligned with the buyer's interests, while preserving the factual content of the original listings. 

#### **5. Use of LLM for Generating Personalized Descriptions**
Finally, an LLM is used to generate **personalized descriptions** for the listings. Based on the buyer's preferences, the system crafts unique and appealing descriptions for the properties, emphasizing the features that matter most to the buyer. These descriptions are designed to make the listings more attractive and engaging, providing a personalized experience for the user. Here is an example of such response:
